	title = {Balancing Germany’s Electricity System},
	abstract = {Previous studies have noted that, surprisingly, Germany’s dramatic expansion of wind and solar energy coincided with a reduction of short-term balancing reserves. This paper provides further and updated evidence, supporting this “German Balancing Paradox”: since 2011 wind and solar energy nearly doubled while reserve requirements and reserve activation declined by around 50\%. We quantitatively explore one reason for reduced balancing needs: increased and improved short-term wholesale electricity trading. Electricity trading is now commonly done around the clock and based on quarter hours, rather than hours. The shift to quarter-hourly products alone explains a decrease in balancing energy by 17\%. we also find strong evidence for market parties to respond efficiently to imbalance charges, suggesting that market-based approaches to balancing work.},

As delivery time approaches, traders must judge whether to trade-out a position or settle it in the balancing market at the as-yet-unknown imbalance price. Forecasting the imbalance price (and related volumes) is therefore a necessity in short-term markets. However, this topic has received surprisingly little attention in the academic literature despite clear need by practitioners. Furthermore, the emergence of algorithmic trading demands automated forecasting and decision-making, with those best able to extract predictive information from available data gaining a competitive advantage. Here we present the case for developing imbalance price forecasting methods and provide motivating examples from the Great Britain’s balancing market, demonstrating forecast skill and value.},

	abstract = {The imbalance market is very volatile and often exhibits extreme price spikes. This makes it very hard to model; however, if predicted correctly, one could make signiﬁcant gains by participating on the right side of the market. In this manuscript, we conduct a very short-term probabilistic forecasting of imbalance prices, contributing to the scarce literature in this novel subject. The forecasting is performed 30 min before the delivery, so that the trader might still choose the trading place. The distribution of the imbalance prices is modelled and forecasted using methods well-known in the electricity price forecasting literature: lasso with bootstrap, gamlss, and probabilistic neural networks. The methods are compared with a naive benchmark in a meaningful rolling window study. The results provide evidence of the efﬁciency between the intraday and balancing markets as the sophisticated methods do not substantially overperform the intraday continuous price index. On the other hand, they signiﬁcantly improve the empirical coverage. Therefore, the traders should avoid participating in the balancing market, which is inline with the objective and current regulations of the market. The analysis was conducted on the German market; however, it could be easily applied to any other market of a similar structure.},

	abstract = {Applying computational statistics or machine learning methods to data is a key component of many scientific studies, in any field, but alone might not be sufficient to generate robust and reliable outcomes and results. Before applying any discovery method, preprocessing steps are necessary to prepare the data to the computational analysis. In this framework, data cleaning and feature engineering are key pillars of any scientific study involving data analysis and that should be adequately designed and performed since the first phases of the project. We call “feature” a variable describing a particular trait of a person or an observation, recorded usually as a column in a dataset. Even if pivotal, these data cleaning and feature engineering steps sometimes are done poorly or inefficiently, especially by beginners and unexperienced researchers. For this reason, we propose here our quick tips for data cleaning and feature engineering on how to carry out these important preprocessing steps correctly avoiding common mistakes and pitfalls. Although we designed these guidelines with bioinformatics and health informatics scenarios in mind, we believe they can more in general be applied to any scientific area. We therefore target these guidelines to any researcher or practitioners wanting to perform data cleaning or feature engineering. We believe our simple recommendations can help researchers and scholars perform better computational analyses that can lead, in turn, to more solid outcomes and more reliable discoveries.},

	title = {Price Forecasting for the Balancing Energy Market Using Machine-Learning Regression},
	abstract = {The importance of price forecasting has gained attention over the last few years, with the growth of aggregators and the general opening of the European electricity markets. Market participants manage a tradeoﬀ between, bidding in a lower price market (day-ahead), but with typically higher volume, or aiming for a lower volume market but with potentially higher returns (balance energy market). Companies try to forecast the extremes of revenues or prices, in order to manage risk and opportunity, assigning their assets in an optimal way. It is thought that in general, electricity markets have quasi-deterministic principles, rather than being based on speculation, hence the desire to forecast the price based on variables that can describe the outcome of the market. Many studies address this problem from a statistical approach or by performing multiple-variable regressions, but they very often focus only on the time series analysis. In 2019, the Loss of Load Probability ({LOLP}) was made available in the {UK} for the ﬁrst time. Taking this opportunity, this study focusses on ﬁve {LOLP} variables (with diﬀerent time-ahead estimations) and other quasi-deterministic variables, to explain the price behavior of a multi-variable regression model. These include base production, system load, solar and wind generation, seasonality, day-ahead price and imbalance volume contributions. Three machine-learning algorithms were applied to test for performance, Gradient Boosting ({GB}), Random Forest ({RF}) and {XGBoost}. {XGBoost} presented higher performance and so it was chosen for the implementation of the real time forecast step. The model returns a Mean Absolute Error ({MAE}) of 7.89 £/{MWh}, a coeﬃcient of determination (R2 score) of 76.8\% and a Mean Squared Error ({MSE}) of 124.74. The variables that contribute the most to the model are the Net Imbalance Volume, the {LOLP} (aggregated), the month and the De-rated margins (aggregated) with 28.6\%, 27.5\%, 14.0\%, and 8.9\% of weight on feature importance respectively.},

	abstract = {Transmission System operators actively balance the electricity system by sending a dispatch signal to suppliers of balancing reserve. When market participants intentionally adapt their intraday positions based on the expected system state, they can also reduce the required dispatch of balancing reserves. This is called passive balancing. The German imbalance price system incites this behavior. This paper examines whether passive balancing prevails in Germany and how it affects the system stability. Our analysis indicates that intraday trading close to gate closure is highly affected by market participants reacting to the latest published system balance ({SB}). This behavior has a positive impact on system balancing. Intraday trading close to gate closure reduces both the required demand of balancing energy and high {SBs} up to 5\% without causing a critical overshoot of the system.},

	title = {Very-Short-Term Probabilistic Forecasting for a Risk-Aware Participation in the Single Price Imbalance Settlement},
	abstract = {The single imbalance pricing is an emerging mechanism in European electricity markets where all positive and negative imbalances are settled at a unique price. This real-time scheme thereby stimulates market participants to deviate from their schedule to restore the power system balance. However, exploiting this market opportunity is very risky due to the extreme volatility of the real-time power system conditions. In order to address this issue, we implement a new tailored deep-learning model, named encoder-decoder, to generate improved probabilistic forecasts of the imbalance signal, by efﬁciently capturing its complex spatiotemporal dynamics. The predicted distributions are then used to quantify and optimize the risk associated with the real-time participation of market players, acting as price-makers, in the imbalance settlement. This leads to an integrated forecast-driven strategy, modeled as a robust bi-level optimization. Results show that our probabilistic forecaster achieves better performance than other state of the art tools, and that the subsequent risk-aware robust dispatch tool allows ﬁnding a tradeoff between conservative and risk-seeking policies, leading to improved economic beneﬁts. Moreover, we show that the model is computationally efﬁcient and can thus be incorporated in the very-short-term dispatch of market players with ﬂexible resources.},

One option considered in many studies dealing with prospective power systems is the installation of storage devices to balance the ﬂuctuations in power production. However, it is not yet clear how soon storage devices will be needed and how the integration process depends on different storage parameters. Using long-term solar and wind energy power production data series, we present a modelling approach to investigate the inﬂuence of storage size and efﬁciency on the pathway towards a 100\% {RES} scenario. Applying our approach to data for Germany, we found that up to 50\% of the overall electricity demand can be met by an optimum combination of wind and solar resources without both curtailment and storage devices if the remaining energy is provided by sufﬁciently ﬂexible power plants. Our ﬁndings show further that the installation of small, but highly efﬁcient storage devices is already highly beneﬁcial for the {RES} integration, while seasonal storage devices are only needed when more than 80\% of the electricity demand can be met by wind and solar energy. Our results imply that a compromise between the installation of additional generation capacities and storage capacities is required.},

This matrix is then used to infer the imbalance prices since the net regulation volume can be related to the level of reserves activated and the corresponding marginal prices for each activation level are published by the Belgian Transmission System Operator one day before electricity delivery. This approach is compared to a deterministic model, a multi-layer perceptron, and a widely used probabilistic technique, Gaussian Processes.},
