\section{Related Work}
\label{Section::Related_Work}

Several other papers have worked on forecasting on the imbalance market. Different energy markets are structured differently. While the imbalance is settled every quarter hour in germany \cite{narajewskiProbabilisticForecastingGerman2022}, each settlement period is 30 minutes on the energy market in the united kingdom \cite{limaBayesianPredictiveDistributions2023}.


The works \cite{limaBayesianPredictiveDistributions2023} \cite{ganeshForecastingImbalancePrice2024} \cite{garciaForecastingSystemImbalance2006} \cite{browellPredictingElectricityImbalance2022} \cite{lucasPriceForecastingBalancing2020} \cite{dengSeasonalityDeepLearning2024} focus on the energy market in the united kingdom and use different approaches. While \cite{limaBayesianPredictiveDistributions2023}, \cite{ganeshForecastingImbalancePrice2024}, \cite{browellPredictingElectricityImbalance2022}, \cite{lucasPriceForecastingBalancing2020} and \cite{dengSeasonalityDeepLearning2024} try to make a prediction about the imbalance price, \cite{garciaForecastingSystemImbalance2006} tries to forecast the total imbalance volume. 

The volume is forecasted using three different methods, ARIMA, exponential smoothing and caterpillar forecasting.

For the papers predicting imbalance prices different models where used.
The authors of \cite{limaBayesianPredictiveDistributions2023} developped a dynamic linear model (DLM) and compared their results to GARCH and AR-GARCH. Their model outperformed GARCH and AR-GARCH on all their out-of-sample forecasting experiments. During their research they also inspected how the imbalance price correlates with the features used in their predictions.
The net imbalance volume was the features with the largest correlation, followed by metrics which try to capture the scarcity of energy.
In \cite{ganeshForecastingImbalancePrice2024} many different neural network algorithms were compared, namely Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) and the Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting (N-BEATS). The FCNNs used in this paper were a significant improvement to the DLM developed in \cite{limaBayesianPredictiveDistributions2023}.
The authors of \cite{browellPredictingElectricityImbalance2022} investigated how much impact the prediction time has on the result. They used Kernel Density Estimators (KDE) and linear regression to get a forecast for the imbalance price. Another result was, that the prediction quality greatly improves if the prediction is done at a time closer to delivery time.
 
 For the imbalance price prediction \ref{lucasPriceForecastingBalancing2020} employed Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost. Out of the models they used RF performed the best. During their research they also looked into feature importance for all their models. They found that the net imbalance volume was the most important feature.
 
 In \cite{dengSeasonalityDeepLearning2024} a new Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and Seasonal Attention BiLSTM (SA-BiLSTM) were compared to the previously used models. The authors looked into forecasting for multiple settlement periods into the future, with SA-BiLSTM performing the best in most of the cases.
 
Apart from the UK energy market some research on the Belgian \cite{bottieauVeryShortTermProbabilisticForecasting2020} \cite{dumasProbabilisticForecastingImbalance2019}, Hungarian \cite{balazsShorttermSystemImbalance2024} and German \cite{narajewskiProbabilisticForecastingGerman2022} electricity market was published.
In the papers \cite{bottieauVeryShortTermProbabilisticForecasting2020} and \cite{balazsShorttermSystemImbalance2024} the authors used machine learning methods and auto regressive methods to predict the system imbalance in their respective energy market.
A two step probabilistic approach was suggested in \cite{dumasProbabilisticForecastingImbalance2019}. First the system imbalance is forecasted and this information is then used in a second prediction for the imbalance price.

The paper on the german electricity market \cite{narajewskiProbabilisticForecastingGerman2022} used lasso regression, gamlss and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) to try to predict the imbalance price for the german electricity market. The data for their models was split into subsets and different models with different hyperparameter configurations trained for each subset.

Many of the mentioned papers, especially the ones on the british electricity market used data from before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic the energy market changed. Models based and calibrated on pre-pandemic data can not be used to effectively forecast current energy prices \cite{abadieEnergyMarketPrices2021}.


In this thesis different models are compared on the task of predicting the imbalance price. 
For this task random forest, arimax, xLSTM (an extension of LSTM) \cite{beckXLSTMExtendedLong2024} and a new inverted Transformer (iTransformer) \cite{liuITransformerInvertedTransformers2023} architecture will be inspected.
Random forest performed well on the task of predicting the imbalance price before the COVID-19 pandemic \ref{lucasPriceForecastingBalancing2020}.


\section{Time Series Predictors}
\label{Section::Time_Series_Predictors}

In this thesis established machine learning models are compared with novel approaches for Time Series Predictors. These newer models will be introduced in the next two subsections.

%\subsection{Random Forest}

\subsection{xLSTM}
\label{Section::xLSTM}
Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) is a novel model which is based on the existing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) \cite{gravesLongShortTermMemory2012}. The recent advances in Transformer technology outperformed LSTM models. 
The goal behind the development of xLSTM was to check whether LSTM models could reach comparable results if the models use the same amount of parameters.
xLSTM introduces two new LSTM cells, sLSTM and mLSTM.

In the sLSTM Cell the activation function is changed. While in LSTM the activation function for the input gate is the sigmoid function, sLSTM uses the exponential function. In sLSTM the activation for the forget gate can be either the sigmoid function or the exponential function. sLSTM cells can also have multiple memory cells. This enables memory mixing via recurrent connections. A residual sLSTM cell contains a sLSTM  cell which summarizes the past in the original space. This is then linearly mapped into a higher-dimensional  space where the non linear activation function is applied. Afterwards the result is mapped back to the original space.

The second alteration of the basic LSTM cell uses a matrix memory instead of a single value. This cell is called mLSTM. It also uses exponential gating for the input gate and either sigmoid or exponential gating for the forget gate. This cell can also have multiple memorry cells, but does not support memory mixing. In a residual mLSTM cell a pre-projection linearly maps to a high-dimensional space. The mLSTM cell then summarizes the past in the high dimensional space. The result is then linearly mapped back to the original space.

An xLSTM architecture is constructed by stacking theses building blocks. An advantage of xLSTM networks is, that the computation complexity is linear and the memory complexity is constant with respect to sequence length. \cite{beckXLSTMExtendedLong2024}



\subsection{iTransformer}
\label{Section::iTransformer}

Contrary to traditional Transformers, inverted Transformers (iTransformer) use inverted inputs. Transformers use temporal embedded tokens, learning one embedding for each distinct timestep across all variates. In iTransformers the input is transposed, changing the axes. This results in each embedding being learned for a single variate across all timesteps. For traditional Transformers the amount of learned embeddings is equal to the amount of timesteps, whereas for iTransformers the amount of learned embeddings is equal to the variates. This is visualized in figure \ref{fig::iTransformer}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

            \caption[Comparison between vanilla Transformer and iTransformer \cite{liuITransformerInvertedTransformers2023}]{Comparison between vanilla Transformer and iTransformer \cite{liuITransformerInvertedTransformers2023}}
            \label{fig::iTransformer}
 \end{figure}
 
The gains of inverting the input is significant. In the experiments the developers of the iTransformer found, that inverting the input had a benefit for various Transformers, namely the vanilla Transformer, Reformer, Informer, Flowformer and Flashformer. 
This research was done on weather data, traffic data and data about the hourly electricity consumption (ECL).
For the training of the iTransformer an updated training procedure was applied. 
For each batch only a subset of the variates are selected and the model is trained on them. 
The updated training process is a lot fasater, while the performance is still comparable with full-variate training. 
Another benefit of this training method is that the needed memory can be reduced significantly as shown in figure \ref{fig::iTransformer_Training} \cite{liuITransformerInvertedTransformers2023}
