\chapter{Methodology} % Outline text
\label{Chapter::Methodology}
This chapter contains information about the data used for the Time Series prediction. 
The data can be separated into 3 thematic fields: weather data, market data and energy data.

In the following sections each data source will be described more in depth. 
This data is processed and filtered in chapter \ref{Chapter::Feature_Engineering}.

This chapter contains a more in depth overview about how the data was aquired and what information is available in the data used for the experiments. 
The data used for the experiments can be separated into 3 thematic fields: energy data, market data and weather data.
This chapter only provides a brief overview about the data sources. 

    
\section{Energy Data}
\label{Section::Energy_Data}

% When is the data available ?

The data used in this thesis is sourced from Netztransparenz and the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform.
The target variable, along with several additional explanatory variables, is obtained from these platforms.

Netztransparenz provides detailed information on the imbalance price and imbalance volumes, which are central to the prediction objective.
This data is available both operational and quality-assured.
The quality-assured data is available about 18 days after the operational data. 
ENTSO-E supplies load and generation data, including both measured values and forecasts, for the German electricity market.
Additionally, specific generation data is available for onshore wind, offshore wind, and solar photovoltaic technologies.

The data covers the German bidding zone exclusively, as the prediction task focuses solely on the German electricity market.
The time resolution of all datasets is quarter-hourly.
The period under study spans from the 21st of june 2022 to 31st of december 2024).

All datasets are accessed and downloaded via publicly available APIs, enabling automated and reproducible data collection.
An overview about all variables used by these data sources can be found in \ref{Table::Energy_Data_Netztransparenz} and \ref{Table::Energy_Data_Entsoe}.

A more detailed description of the preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis will be provided in later sections.

\section{Market Data}
\label{Section::Market_Data}

The market data used in this thesis is provided by Energy-Charts \ref{EnergyCharts}.


Out of the data provided on the website, the prices for Day Ahead Auction, average intraday price, as well as id1 and id3 are used. 
More information about the used variables can be found in table \ref{Table::Market_Data}.

Each intraday index represents the volume-weighted average price of the trades during a certain period. 
While index 1 (ID1) only considers trades that happened up to 1 hour before gate closure, index 3 (ID3) considers trades up to 3 hours before gate closure time.
The variable Intraday continuous average is the volume-weighted average price of all trades that happened on the intraday market. 
This will be called ID FULL going further.

As described in \ref{Section::Imbalance_Price} one of the imbalance price modules is tied to the recent market situation.

\section{Weather data}
\label{Section::Weather_Data}

The weather data used for the prediction of the imbalance price is obtained from the German Weather Service (DWD).
The dataset includes both measured weather observations and forecasted weather variables, with a time resolution of  1 hour.

Measured weather data is made available approximately one hour after observation, while weather forecasts cover a forecast horizon of up to 10 days into the future.

Since the generation of variable renewable energy (VRE) is highly dependent on weather conditions, the incorporation of weather data is essential for accurate modeling.
The data is aggregated from 16 weather stations distributed across Germany.
A complete list of the selected weather stations is provided in Appendix \ref{List::Weather_Stations}, and their geographic locations are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig::weather_stations}.

The full range of available weather variables for the measurements is summarized in Table \ref{Table::DWD_Measurement_Parameters}.
An overview about all available forecast variables can be found in the appendix (table \ref{Table::DWD_MOSMIX_Parameters}).
For the prediction task, a selected subset of forecast variables is used, as detailed in Table \ref{Table::DWD_MOSMIX_Parameters_Small}.


More information about how the data is handled will be discussed in section \ref{Section::Feature_Engineering}
